# CSA-MDM-121: Computational Statistics  
## Sectionâ€“B: Programming Tasks (MID-II Assignments)

This repository contains the solutions for **Sectionâ€“B: Programming Tasks** of the course  
**CSA-MDM-121: Computational Statistics (MID-II Assignments)**.  

Each question is implemented in Python with clear code, comments, and outputs.  
The repository is organized so that each task is in a separate file for easy navigation and evaluation.

## ðŸ“‚ Contents
- **Q1:** [Mean, Median, Mode, Weighted Mean](Q1_mean_median_mode.py)  
  *Calculates basic statistical measures (mean, median, mode) using Pythonâ€™s `statistics` module and includes a custom function for weighted mean.*  

- **Q2:** [Range, Variance, Skewness, Kurtosis](Q2_variance_stddev.py)  
  *Computes range, variance, skewness, and kurtosis to analyze data distribution and spread.*  

- **Q3:** [Central Limit Theorem Simulation](Q3_dice_simulation.py)  
  *Simulates repeated sampling to demonstrate the Central Limit Theorem and visualize sample means approaching normal distribution.*  

- **Q4:** [Correlation & Regression](Q4_regression.py)  
  *Performs correlation analysis and simple linear regression (e.g., study hours vs exam scores) to show relationships between variables.*  

- **Q5:** [Hypothesis Testing](Q5_hypothesis_test.py)  
  *Conducts a two-sample t-test to compare class averages and determine if the difference is statistically significant.*
